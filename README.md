# Upsampling of Point Clouds

## Overview  
**Point Clouds** are 3D data representations captured from **LiDAR sensors, 3D scanners, or depth cameras**. They are widely used in **autonomous driving, robotics, VR/AR, and 3D object reconstruction**.  

This project explores **point cloud upsampling** using **Deep Learning architectures like PointNet and PointNet++**. The goal is to enhance the resolution of sparse point clouds, improving their quality for classification, recognition, and reconstruction tasks.

## What is Point Cloud Upsampling?  
Upsampling point clouds involves **increasing point density** while preserving object structure. This is essential for:  
- **3D Object Classification & Recognition** 📦  
- **LiDAR Data Processing for Autonomous Vehicles** 🚗  
- **Medical Imaging & 3D Reconstruction** 🏥  
- **Virtual Reality (VR) & Augmented Reality (AR)** 🎮  

**PointNet & PointNet++** are deep learning models that process raw point cloud data directly, making them effective for upsampling and classification.
